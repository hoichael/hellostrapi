          riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay,
          brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle
          and Environs. Sir Tristram, violer d'amores, fr'over the short sea,
          had passen- core rearrived from North Armorica on this side the
          scraggy isthmus of Europe Minor to wielderfight his penisolate war:
          nor had topsawyer's rocks by the stream Oconee exaggerated themselse
          to Laurens County's gorgios while they went doublin their mumper all
          the time: nor avoice from afire bellowsed mishe mishe to tauftauf

          malt had Jhem or Shen brewed by arclight and rory end to the

          through all christian minstrelsy. The great fall of the offwall
          entailed at such short notice the pftjschute of Finnegan, erse solid
          man, that the humptyhillhead of humself prumptly sends an unquiring
